# Connecting files to front end

# Building the front end of the app to test the
# functionality of classes/functions from group 1
# The structure of the lib folder is as follows:
# source_files are were the majority of all files are located
# direct_select.dart is a library that holds packages and files
# for the front end to work, primarily dropdown menu and menu choices
# inside of source_files you will see the following dart files:
# base.dart, enum.dart, overlay.dart, scroll_controller.dart,
# widget.dart, widget_drag.dart, and widget_tap.dart
# the purpose of these files are to format the front end
# these files are inspired by an open source app found on github
# on github you can search for: diegoveloper/fultter_direct_select
# this is where you can see the code that the front end was based off of

# as of October 4th the following will still need to be worked on:
# ability to select more than one option from the drop down menus
# create routes to separate pages for:
# displaying my ingredients and compatible recipies
